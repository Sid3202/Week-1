# Week-1
Waste Classification Using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) This project uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to classify images of waste into different categories, such as organic and recyclable waste. The goal is to train a model that can automatically identify and classify different types of waste based on images.
